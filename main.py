    This is a text-based game which is about solving small puzzles to move
    forward. In the game are seven rooms, and in each room you have to do
    a tast or series of tasks to unlock the next room.

    In an attempt to make it a little more interesting I have chosen to do this
    in a fictional world based on The Elder Scrolls video game series.

    The game is written in Python.

    The game was created by me, Andr√© Johansson, a student at Blekinge

    I like games, coding, tv series, cars, planes, space, art, design and many

    job, which is the reason I'm studying web programming. It's good fun.
